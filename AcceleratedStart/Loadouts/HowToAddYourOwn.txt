To add your own loadout to the mod, simply create a new .txt file in this folder. Files that start with "HowTo" 
(such as this one!) are ignored.
In the file, add each item on its own line. You must use the game's internal name for the item, which may be different
from the one you are familiar with.
-------------\
==> Example:
Fins
Seaglide
DoubleTank
-------------/

If you want multiple of a certain item, you can add a comma followed by a number after that item on the same line.
-------------\
==> Example:
Battery, 4
Copper, 12
-------------/

You can add comments to your file by using '#'. Any line that starts with that character is ignored.
-------------\
==> Example:
Fins
# This is a comment and ignored by the mod.
Seaglide
-------------/

Finally, make sure that the list of things you're trying to add actually fits into the lifepod's inventory! The game
will stop adding your items as soon as the maximum size is reached.


Below you'll find a large list of possible items to add to your loadouts. These have NOT been individually tested so if
you put in something weird and it breaks the mod or your game just remove it. This is also not an exhaustive list. If a
specific item that you want is missing the best place to look is that item's page on the Subnautica Wiki, where you can
find the item's internal name under "Debug Spawn".
If you make any mistakes or spelling errors that lead to any of your items not being recognised, the mod will show an
error in the logfile in Subnautica/BepInEx/LogOutput.log, but otherwise do its best to keep going.
